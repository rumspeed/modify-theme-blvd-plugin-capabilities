# Modify Theme Blvd Plugin Capabilities

Modify capabilities to allow Editors access to Theme Blvd plugins

## Features

* Enables Theme Blvd Builder in the Admin for users with edit_pages capabilities (by default Editors)
* Enables Theme Blvd Slider in the Admin for users with edit_pages capabilities (by default Editors)


## Planned Enhancements 

* TODO - add "Editor Capabilities" section to Theme Options "Configuration" tab
* TODO - add checkboxes to enable: Builder, Slider, Widget Areas, Theme Options
* TODO - modify rum_modify_theme_blvd_module_caps() to retrieve Theme Option data and enable accordingly

## Contents

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* This README, a ChangeLog, and a `gitignore` file.
* A subdirectory called `modify-theme-blvd-plugin-capabilities` that represents the core plugin file.

## Installation

1. Copy the `modify-theme-blvd-plugin-capabilities` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the *Plugins* dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads Modify Theme Blvd Plugin Capabilities
4. Click on *Activate*

This will activate the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality, nothing will be added to WordPress; however, this demonstrates exactly how your plugin should behave while you're working with the Boilerplate.
